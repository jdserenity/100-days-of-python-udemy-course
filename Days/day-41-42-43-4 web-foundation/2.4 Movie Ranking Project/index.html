<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>300</h3>
<p>Very stylistically awesome movie that has great moral messages about honour and doing what is right even if it means pain. And how to accept that pain with grace.</p>
<h3>Michael Clayton</h3>
<p>Amazing movie about doing what is right even when the benefits of the wrong you are doing are extremely high such as money, fame, and power. Doing what is right is always more important and it's all that means anything in the end. Great story. Great acting. 5 Stars.</p>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>Really fun Steven Speilberg movie about virtual reality. I love virtual reality so this one hits home to the child in me. Book is really good too I've read it twice haha.</p>
